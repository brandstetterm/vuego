# VueGo

This repository contains the implementation of a Sign Up, Login, and User
Settings page for changing email, password, and uploading a profile picture.
The frontend is built using Vue, TypeScript, and possibly TailwindCSS for
styling, while the backend is built using Go and Gin. The database and S3
storage for profile pictures are managed using Supabase.
